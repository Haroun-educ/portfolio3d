## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Haroun-educ/portfolio3d.git
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

The project is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. Just push your changes to the main branch, and the workflow will handle the deployment.

## Customization

- Update personal information in the page components
- Replace placeholder images with your own
- Add your own 3D models in the `src/models` directory
- Modify colors and styling in the Tailwind configuration

## Performance Optimization

### Recent Improvements
The portfolio has been optimized with several performance enhancements:

1. **SEO Optimization**
   - Added comprehensive meta tags for better search engine visibility
   - Implemented Open Graph tags for improved social media sharing
   - Added Twitter Card support
   - Included canonical URL to prevent duplicate content issues

2. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Optimized image loading with proper sizing and compression
   - Improved 3D model rendering with optimized geometries and materials
   - Added loading states and skeleton screens for better perceived performance
   - Implemented debounce functions for performance-intensive operations

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Added preference saving for dark mode and language settings
   - Enhanced navigation with smooth scrolling and URL hash updates
   - Improved form validation and feedback for the contact form
   - Added glass-effect UI components for a modern look

### Image Optimization
For better performance, especially on mobile devices:

1. Compress all images before adding them to the project
   - Use tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)
   - Aim for image sizes under 200KB when possible
   - Use WebP format instead of JPG/PNG for better compression

2. Use appropriate image dimensions
   - Don't use images larger than needed for their display size
   - Consider creating different sizes for different devices

### 3D Performance
The 3D elements can be resource-intensive on mobile devices:

1. The site automatically shows a simplified version on mobile devices
2. For further optimization, you can:
   - Reduce polygon count in 3D models
   - Use simpler materials
   - Implement level-of-detail (LOD) for complex scenes

3. Current optimizations include:
   - Memory-efficient rendering with useRef and useMemo hooks
   - Optimized lighting and shadows
   - Reduced geometry complexity for better mobile performance
